around Zeno, interesting research and projects on AI evaluation, and new Zeno features.\\n\\nBefore we dive in, we wanted to look back at the last few months since we launched [Zeno Hub](https://hub.zenoml.com).\\nOur users have created over **800 projects** and **1,400 slices** to evaluate more than **10,000 AI systems**!\\nThese insights have been used to author over **160 reports**, communicating interesting findings and insights.\\nIt\'s exciting to see how Zeno is being used to make AI evaluation more accessible and transparent.\\n\\n## \ud83c\udf0e Community\\n\\n_Highlighting work from the Zeno community._\\n\\n### [An In-Depth Look at Gemini\'s Language Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11444)\\n\\nResearchers at CMU, including the Zeno team, conducted a [deep dive into Gemini\'s language abilities](https://x.com/gneubig/status/1737108966931673191?s=20).\\nThey compared Gemini Pro, Google\'s newly released LLM, with GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4-Turbo, and Mixtral.\\nOverall, they found that Gemini approaches but lags behind GPT-3.5-Turbo in all English tasks, yet performs better in translation into languages it supports.\\nFor more detailed results, [read the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11444) or explore the code on [GitHub](https://t.co/S7S9473xtP).\\nEach section of the paper is linked to a Zeno report for further exploration!\\n\\n### [HuggingFace is Dropping DROP](https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboard-drop-dive)\\n\\nThe HuggingFace [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) is a popular repository for comparing new LLMs. HuggingFace recently added [three new benchmarks](https://twitter.com/clefourrier/status/1722555555338956840) to their leaderboard to better represent real-world performance.\\nAfter receiving feedback from the community, they noticed significant fluctuations in the scores for one benchmark, DROP.\\n[Using Zeno](https://hub.zenoml.com/report/1255/DROP%20Benchmark%20Exploration), they uncovered the reason behind the variance and decided to remove DROP from the leaderboard until a revised version of the benchmark is developed.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcf0 Evaluation News\\n\\n_Interesting news from the world of AI evaluation._\\n\\n### [CRUXEval](https://crux-eval.github.io/)\\n\\nResearchers from MIT and Meta AI Research released new evaluation dataset for code reasoning, understanding, and execution.\\nInstead of having models generate code, CRUXEval asks models to either predict the output or input of a given function based on its signature.\\nThis dataset, which includes 800 python functions, supplements classic code generation datasets such as HumanEval and MBPP.\\nThey compared multiple open and closed-source models on their new benchmarks and found that there is quite a bit of room for improvement.\\n\\n### [CommonGen Leaderboard](https://inklab.usc.edu/CommonGen/leaderboard.html)\\n\\nCommonGen is a challenging benchmark task asking models to generate coherent sentences describing everyday scenarios.\\nThe reseaerchers behind the benchmark, from USC, Allen AI, and UW, recently updated their [eval repository](https://github.com/allenai/CommonGen-Eval) with a [new leaderboard](https://inklab.usc.edu/CommonGen/leaderboard.html) for the task, showing how state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4, perform significantly worse than humans.\\nThe authors argue that the task is so hard because it requires relational reasoning using background common sense knowledge and the models need to be able to generalize to unseen concept combinations.\\n\\n## \u2728 New in Zeno\\n\\n_Updates to Zeno that you\'ll love._\\n\\n### Integrations\\n\\nWe\'ve been focusing on making it even easier for you to analyze your evaluation results in Zeno by [integrating Zeno into other AI evaluation frameworks](https://zenoml.com/docs/integrations/).\\nYou can now directly upload your model outputs if you\'re using the [EleutherAI LM Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) or the [Ragas Framework](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/index.html).\\n\\n- **Ragas** is a library for model-graded evaluation of RAG applications. We\'ve added [a detailed tutorial](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/howtos/integrations/zeno.html) on how to use Zeno to investigate your evaluation results. You can view an example of this in Zeno [here](https://hub.zenoml.com/project/b35c83b8-0b22-4b9c-aedb-80964011d7a7/ragas%20FICA%20eval).\\n\\n- **EleutherAI LM Evaluation Harness** is a popular library for running LLM benchmarks. We wrote a script that allows you to directly upload all your evaluation data as a Zeno project, enabling you to compare different models across various benchmarks provided by EleutherAI. To start visualizing your LM Evaluation Harness data in Zeno, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness#visualizing-results) or take a look at our [example notebook](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/examples/visualize-zeno.ipynb). We\'ve already used this integration for some of our own projects, such as [this evaluation of the Mamba architecture](https://hub.zenoml.com/project/ba44d31c-9e02-4330-bdbe-0760dfe85dc4/Mamba%20Eval_hellaswag)!\\n\\n### Documentation\\n\\nWe\'ve also been working on improving our documentation to make it easier for you to get started with Zeno.\\nThis includes [use cases](http://localhost:3000/docs/examples/), [tutorials](https://zenoml.com/docs/tutorials/), and [integration guides](https://zenoml.com/docs/integrations/).\\nIf you have any suggestions for what you\'d like to see in our documentation, please let us know!\\n\\n---\\n\\n_If you have questions about Zeno or anything we\'ve highlighted in this newsletter, have ideas for new Zeno features or content for a future issue of Zeno\'s Notes, or simply want to say hi, get in touch via [email](mailto:hello@zenoml.com) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/km62pDKAkE)._"}]}')}}]);
