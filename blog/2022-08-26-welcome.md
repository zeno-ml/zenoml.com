Model evaluation beyond aggregate metrics is important.
Finding issues like [fairness concerns](http://gendershades.org/), [safety issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Elaine_Herzberg).

This process is hard, ends up being ad-hoc and manual.
Person might look at a couple of failures one at a time.
Wait for end-users to report.
Creat a couple of slices for important subsets.
Lose it in a notebook.

Zeno is a framework for slice-based evaluation of models.
Mostly an interactive interface for looking at data and model outputs.
Can create slices and explore slice performance.

Can save slices, compare across models, and export visualizations.
