Model evaluation is a key part of the machine learning development process.
Evaluation often stops at measuring metrics such as accuracy, but aggregate metrics are a limited view of model performance.
It's important to look at specific failures or subgroups of data to develop a nuanced view of model performance and discover issues such as [biases](http://gendershades.org/) and [safety concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Elaine_Herzberg).

[**Zeno**](https://zenoml.com) is a framework for fine-grained evaluation of diverse machine learning models.
Zeno is primarily a UI for interactively exploring your data, model outputs, and metrics.
You can interactively filter your data using metadata and create slices to track and compare model performance.
Lastly, you can create visualizations and reports to summarize model performance and share insights with other stakeholders.
