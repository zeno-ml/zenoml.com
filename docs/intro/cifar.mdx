# CIFAR-10 Example

This short example introduces the core concepts in Zeno by walking through a setup for the CIFAR-10 image classification task.

Start by installing the Zeno library and the view for image classification:

```bash
pip install zenoml zenoml-image-classification
```

## Explore the data

First, we'll download the images for CIFAR-10 in a new folder:

```bash
mkdir zeno-cifar/
cd zeno-cifar
git clone https://github.com/YoongiKim/CIFAR-10-images
```

Now, we can create a file called `zeno.toml` with some basic properties:

```toml title="zeno.toml"
view = "zenoml-image-classification"
metadata = "./cifar_pred.csv"
data_path = "./CIFAR-10-images/test/"
data_column = "id"
```

## Implement a model

## Add a distill function

## Add a transform function
