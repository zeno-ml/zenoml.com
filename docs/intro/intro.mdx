# Introduction

Zeno is a general-purpose framework for evaluating machine learning models.
It combines a **Python API** with an **interactive user interface** to empower you to discover, explore, and analyze the performance of your models across diverse use cases.
Zeno can be used for any data type or task with [modular views](/docs/views/) for everything from object detection to audio transcription.

See the [Getting Started](/docs/intro/get_started) and [CIFAR-10 Example](/docs/intro/cifar) pages to set up Zeno and learn about the core concepts.

## Key Features

Zeno uses a Python decorator API to generate data and model information that is used to scaffold the interactive evaluation UI.

### Python API

<div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
  <p style={{ marginRight: "20px" }}>
    The Python API consists of four core decorator functions that you can use to plug your models in and generate information for evaluation. 
    The <code>@model</code> functions return model outputs for any Python-based model or API, which can then be evaluated with <code>@metric</code> functions.
    To test more diverse use cases <code>@distill</code> functions can be used to create new metadata columns based on raw data instances, and <code>@transform</code> functions can be used to perturb data and create new instances. 
  </p>
  <CodeBlock language="python" title="Example Zeno API functions">
    {`@metric
def accuracy(df, ops):
    return df[ops.label_column] 
            == df[ops.output_column]
`}
    {`
@distill
def brightness(df, ops):
    return lum(df[ops.data_column]))
`}
  </CodeBlock>

</div>

### Exploration UI

<div style={{display: 'flex'}}>
<img style={{padding: '5px', width: '50%', marginRight: '20px', objectFit: 'contain'}} src="/img/explore.png" />
<div>
<p>
    Zeno's Exploration UI is the main interface for evaluation.
    It lets you slice and dice your data to quickly see how your model works for different types of instances.
    You can pick different models and transforms, and also transform your data to see how perturbations impact model performance.
</p>

<p>
    The instance view is modular, and supports any data type or task.
    Existing views can be found <a href="/docs/views">here</a>, and new views can be written for unsupported data types.

</p>

</div>

### Analysis UI

<div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
	<img
		style={{
			padding: "5px",
			width: "50%",
			marginRight: "20px",
			objectFit: "contain",
		}}
		src="/img/analyze.png"
	/>
	<p>
		The Analysis UI is used to compare models over time and create
		<i> behavioral unit tests</i>. You can create reports for groups of instance
		and see how new models compare with sparkline visualizations and trends.
		To catch potential regressions, you can create tests of expected metrics
		for slices. Reports can be shared and exported as PDFs.
	</p>
</div>

## Why Zeno?

Zeno helps you move beyond relying on aggregate metrics and spot-checking model outputs.
Instead, it allows you to develop a deep and quantitative understanding of how your model behaves.

Zeno supports your workflow - it is **model and data agnostic**, and requires just a single Python function to start working.
It also lets you test **diverse mode use cases**, from potential fairness concerns to robustness checks.
Lastly, Zeno lets you **compare your models** and detect potential regressions as you release updates.
