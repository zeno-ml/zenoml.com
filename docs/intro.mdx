# Getting Started

Zeno is an **interactive platform for AI evaluation** for exploring, discovering and reporting the performance of your models.
Use it for any data type or task with Zeno's [modular views](/docs/views/) for everything from object detection to audio transcription and chatbot conversations.
Zeno helps you move beyond aggregate metrics and spot-checking model outputs to develop a deep and quantitative understanding of how your model behaves.

To get an idea of Zeno's features, you can explore public projects and reports in [Zeno Hub](https://hub.zenoml.com).
For example, take a look at a [report evaluating how well LLMs like GPT-4 do on language translation](https://hub.zenoml.com/report/cabreraalex/GPT%20MT%20Benchmark%20Report), along with the [underlying data used to create the report.](https://hub.zenoml.com/project/cabreraalex/GPT%20MT%20Benchmark/explore).

Check out the [Using Zeno](/docs/using-zeno/) section for more information on how to use Zeno to evaluate your models.

## Creating a Project

To create your own projects and reports, first create an account on [Zeno Hub](https://hub.zenoml.com/signup).
After logging in to Zeno Hub, generate your API key by clicking on your profile at the bottom left to navigate to your [account page](https://hub.zenoml.com/account).

Next, install the `zeno-client` Python package, which is used to upload new datasets and AI system outputs:

```bash
pip install zeno-client
```

In a Python script or notebook we can now create a new project:

```python
from zeno_client import ZenoClient

client = ZenoClient("YOUR API KEY HERE")
```

Now lets load some text data to analyze. The client API works with Pandas DataFrames, so we can create a sample DataFrame looking at text sentiment classification:

```python
from zeno_client import ZenoClient
# highlight-next-line
import pandas as pd

client = ZenoClient("YOUR API KEY HERE")

# highlight-start
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "text": [
            "I love this movie!",
            "I hate this movie!",
            "This movie is ok.",
        ],
        "label": ["positive", "negative", "neutral"],
    }
)

# Explicitly save the index as a column to upload.
df["id"] = df.index

# Add any additional columns you want to do analysis across.
df["input length"] = df["text"].str.len()

# highlight-end
```

Let's create a project for this task. **Projects** in Zeno are a base dataset and any number of AI system outputs, and are used to evaluate and compare AI system performance. Here we create a project and upload our base dataset.

```python
from zeno_client import ZenoClient, ZenoMetric

...

project = client.create_project(
    "Sentiment Classification",
    "text-classification",
    metrics=[
        ZenoMetric(name="accuracy", type="mean", columns=["correct"]),
    ]
)

project.upload_dataset(df, id_column="id", label_column="label", data_column='text')
```

We named our project "Sentiment Classification" and specified that it is a text classification task.
Check out all supported data types and tasks [here](https://zenoml.com/docs/views/).
We also added an initial accuracy metric which takes the mean of the `correct` column, which will be present in the system outputs we upload later.

Next, we can upload some system outputs to evaluate. Here we'll upload some fake predictions from a model:

```python

...

df_system = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "output": ["positive", "negative", "negative"],
    }
)

# Create an id column to match the base dataset.
df_system["id"] = df_system.index

# Measure accuracy for each instance, which is averaged by the ZenoMetric above.
df_system["correct"] = df_system["output"] == df["label"]

proj.upload_system("System A", df_system, output_column="output", id_column="id")
```

You can now navigate to the project URL in Zeno Hub to see the uploaded data and metrics and start exploring your AI system's performance!

#### Complete Example

```python
from zeno_client import ZenoClient, ZenoMetric
import pandas as pd

client = ZenoClient("YOUR API KEY HERE")

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "text": [
            "I love this movie!",
            "I hate this movie!",
            "This movie is ok.",
        ],
        "label": ["positive", "negative", "neutral"],
    }
)

# Explicitly save the index as a column to upload.
df["id"] = df.index

# Add any additional columns you want to do analysis across.
df["input length"] = df["text"].str.len()

project = client.create_project(
    "Sentiment Classification",
    "text-classification",
    metrics=[
        ZenoMetric(name="accuracy", type="mean", columns=["correct"]),
    ]
)

project.upload_dataset(df, id_column="id", label_column="label", data_column='text')

df_system = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "output": ["positive", "negative", "negative"],
    }
)

# Create an id column to match the base dataset.
df_system["id"] = df_system.index

# Measure accuracy for each instance, which is averaged by the ZenoMetric above.
df_system["correct"] = (df_system["output"] == df["label"]).astype(int)

project.upload_system("System A", df_system, output_column="output", id_column="id")
```

## Quickstart with Zeno Build

[Zeno Build](https://github.com/zeno-ml/zeno-build) is a Python library that makes it easy to set up Zeno projects for common AI and ML tasks.

Follow the [Zeno Build Tutorial](https://github.com/zeno-ml/zeno-build/tree/main/docs/tutorial) to learn the basic Zeno concepts on an example LLM task.
