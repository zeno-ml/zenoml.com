# Getting Started

Zeno is an **interactive platform for AI evaluation**.
With Zeno, you can discover, explore, and analyze the performance of your models across diverse use cases.
Zeno can be used for any data type or task with [modular views](/docs/views/) for everything from object detection to audio transcription and chatbot conversations.

## Why Zeno?

Zeno helps you move beyond relying on aggregate metrics and spot-checking model outputs.
Instead, it allows you to develop a deep and quantitative understanding of how your model behaves.

Zeno supports your workflow - it is **model and data agnostic**, and requires just a single Python function to start working.
It also lets you test **diverse mode use cases**, from potential fairness concerns to robustness checks.
Lastly, Zeno lets you **compare your models** and detect potential regressions as you release updates.

## Quickstart

You can explore public projects in [Zeno Hub](https://hub.zenoml.com).

To upload your own data, create an account on [Zeno Hub](https://hub.zenoml.com/signup).
After logging in to ZenoHub, you can get your API key for uploading data at [hub.zenoml.com/account](https://hub.zenoml.com/account).
Then, install the [Zeno Client](https://github.com/zeno-ml/zeno-client).

```bash
pip install zeno-client
```

## Getting Started with Zeno Build

The best way to get started with Zeno is with [Zeno Build](https://github.com/zeno-ml/zeno-build), a Python library that makes it easy to set up Zeno projects for common AI and ML tasks.

Follow the [Zeno Build Tutorial](https://github.com/zeno-ml/zeno-build/tree/main/docs/tutorial) to learn the basic Zeno concepts on an example LLM task.
