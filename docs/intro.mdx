# What is Zeno?

Zeno is an **interactive AI evaluation platform** for exploring, discovering and reporting the performance of your models.
Use it for any task and data type with Zeno's [modular views](/docs/views/) for everything from object detection to audio transcription and chatbot conversations.
Zeno helps you move beyond aggregate metrics and spot-checking model outputs to develop a deep and quantitative understanding of how your model behaves.

:::tip
Head over to [Zeno Hub](https://hub.zenoml.com) to explore public Zeno projects and reports.
For example, take a look at a [report evaluating how well LLMs like GPT-4 do on language translation](https://hub.zenoml.com/report/cabreraalex/GPT%20MT%20Benchmark%20Report), along with the [underlying data used to create the report](https://hub.zenoml.com/project/cabreraalex/GPT%20MT%20Benchmark/explore).

Check out the [Using Zeno](/docs/using-zeno/) docs for more information on how to use the Zeno interface.

The best way to use Zeno is with your own data and models.
