# Getting Started

Zeno is an **interactive AI evaluation platform** for exploring, debugging, and sharing how your AI systems perform.
Evaluate any task and data type with Zeno's [modular views](/docs/views/) which support everything from chatbot conversations to object detection and audio transcription.

## Creating a Project

The core of Zeno are **projects**, which consist of a base evaluation dataset and any number of AI system outputs.
We'll walk through creating your first project step by step, which will result in this final project example:

<details>
  <summary>Complete Example</summary>
  <div>
    ```python
    from zeno_client import ZenoClient, ZenoMetric
    import pandas as pd
    
    client = ZenoClient("YOUR API KEY HERE")
    
    df = pd.DataFrame(
      {
          "id": [1, 2, 3],
          "text": [
              "I love this movie!",
              "I hate this movie!",
              "This movie is ok.",
          ],
          "label": ["positive", "negative", "neutral"],
      }
    )

    # Add any additional columns you want to do analysis across.
    df["input length"] = df["text"].str.len()

    # Create a project.
    project = client.create_project(
    name="Sentiment Classification",
    view="text-classification",
    metrics=[
        ZenoMetric(name="accuracy", type="mean", columns=["correct"]),
      ]
    )

    # Upload the data.
    project.upload_dataset(df, id_column="id", data_column='text', label_column="label")

    # Create a system DataFrame.
    df_system = pd.DataFrame(
      {
        "output": ["positive", "negative", "negative"],
      }
    )

    # Create an id column to match the base dataset.
    df_system["id"] = df_system.index

    # Measure accuracy for each instance, which is averaged by the ZenoMetric above.
    df_system["correct"] = (df_system["output"] == df["label"]).astype(int)

    proj.upload_system(df_system, name="System A", id_column="id", output_column="output")
    ```

  </div>
</details>

### Creating a Zeno Account

If you don't have a Zeno account already, create one on [Zeno Hub](https://hub.zenoml.com/signup).
After logging in to Zeno Hub, generate your API key by clicking on your profile at the top right to navigate to your [account page](https://hub.zenoml.com/account).

### Using the Python API

Zeno projects are created and managed using the `zeno-client` Python library:

```bash
pip install zeno-client
```

We can now initialize a client with the API key which we will use to create projects and upload data.

```python
from zeno_client import ZenoClient, ZenoMetric
import pandas as pd

# Initialize a client with our API key.
client = ZenoClient("YOUR API KEY HERE")
```

### Setting up Your Data

Zeno projects take data and model outputs as **Pandas DataFrames**.
In this example, we will upload a toy example of sentiment classification with 3 instances and ground truth labels:

```python
...

# Put all data in a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "id": [1, 2, 3],
        "text": [
            "I love this movie!",
            "I hate this movie!",
            "This movie is ok.",
        ],
        "label": ["positive", "negative", "neutral"],
    }
)

# Add any additional columns you want to do analysis across.
df["input length"] = df["text"].str.len()
```

:::tip
Every DataFrame in Zeno requires a unique `id_column` that identifies each instance. This is used to match the base dataset with system outputs.
:::

### Initializing a Project

We can now initialize a **project** using the client and upload our base dataset:

```python
...

project = client.create_project(
    name="Sentiment Classification",
    view="text-classification",
    metrics=[
        ZenoMetric(name="accuracy", type="mean", columns=["correct"]),
    ]
)

project.upload_dataset(df, id_column="id", data_column='text', label_column="label")
```

We named our project _Sentiment Classification_ and specified to use the _text_classification_ view.
We also added an _accuracy_ metric which takes the mean of the `correct` column that will be present in the system outputs we upload later.

:::tip
Learn more about Zeno's `view` specification in the [instance view docs](/docs/views).
You can find the default supported views [here](/docs/views/existing).
:::

### Uploading AI System Outputs

Lastly, we can upload our AI system outputs to the project.
We add an `id` column to match the base dataset and a `correct` column that measures accuracy for each instance.

```python
...

df_system = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "output": ["positive", "negative", "negative"],
    }
)

# Create an id column to match the base dataset.
df_system["id"] = df_system.index

# Measure accuracy for each instance, which is averaged by the ZenoMetric above.
df_system["correct"] = (df_system["output"] == df["label"]).astype(int)

proj.upload_system(df_system, name="System A", id_column="id", output_column="output")
```

You can now navigate to the project URL in Zeno Hub to see the uploaded data and metrics and start exploring your AI system's performance!

## Quickstart with Zeno Build

[Zeno Build](https://github.com/zeno-ml/zeno-build) is a collection of example projects for common AI and ML tasks. Check out some common Zeno Build notebooks:

- [EleutherAI LM Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/zeno-ml/zeno-build/tree/main/examples/eleuther_harness)
- [ðŸ¤— OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://github.com/zeno-ml/zeno-build/tree/main/examples/open_llm_leaderboard)
- [Audio Transcription Bias](https://github.com/zeno-ml/zeno-build/tree/main/examples/transcription)
