# Introduction

Zeno is an **interactive platform for AI evaluation**.
With Zeno, you can discover, explore, and analyze the performance of your models across diverse use cases.
Zeno can be used for any data type or task with [modular views](/docs/views/) for everything from object detection to audio transcription and chatbot conversations.

See the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) to set up Zeno and learn about the core concepts.

### Explore Model Performance

<div className="intro-container" style={{display: 'flex'}}>
<img className="intro-image"  src="/img/explore.png" />
<div>
<p>
    Zeno's Exploration UI is the main interface for evaluation.
    It lets you slice and dice your data to quickly see how your model works for different types of instances.
    You can pick different models and metrics to see model performance.
</p>

<p>
    The modular instance view supports any data type or task.
    Existing views can be found <a href="/docs/views">here</a>, and new views can be written for unsupported data types.

</p>

### Interactive Visualizations

<div className="intro-container" style={{ display: "flex" }}>
  <img className="intro-image" src="/img/analyze.png" />
  <p>
    Zeno empowers you to create interactive visualizations and reports for
    summarizing and sharing insights of model performance. Zeno charts are
    live-updated with your data and model outputs, keeping a fresh view of model
    performance. Interactive reports can be shared publicly, exported as PDFs,
    and easily reproduced by others.
  </p>
</div>

### Shareable Reports

### Python API

<div className="intro-container" style={{ display: "flex" }}>
  <p style={{ marginRight: "20px" }}>
    The Python client can be used to upload your own projects to Zeno.
    You can create projects, add data, and upload system outputs.
    All you need is your raw data, any metadata in a pandas dataframe, and your system or model specific metadata in another dataframe.
  </p>
  <CodeBlock language="python" title="Example Zeno Client Upload">
    {`
    from zeno_client import ZenoClient
    `}
    {`import pandas as pd
    `}
    {`
    client = ZenoClient("YOUR_API_KEY")
    `}
    {`project = client.create_project("my_project", "my_view")
    `}
    {`df = df.load_csv("my_dataset.csv")
    `}
    {`project.upload_dataset(
        df, id_column="id", label_column="label", data_column='text'
    )
    `}
    {`
    ... run inference on your model ...
    `}
    {`
    df = pd.DataFrame({"id": [1, 2, 3], "output": ["A", "B", "A"]})
    `}
    {`project.upload_system(
      "my_system", df, output_column="output", id_column="id"
    )
    `}
  </CodeBlock>

## Why Zeno?

Zeno helps you move beyond relying on aggregate metrics and spot-checking model outputs.
Instead, it allows you to develop a deep and quantitative understanding of how your model behaves.

Zeno supports your workflow - it is **model and data agnostic**, and requires just a single Python function to start working.
It also lets you test **diverse mode use cases**, from potential fairness concerns to robustness checks.
Lastly, Zeno lets you **compare your models** and detect potential regressions as you release updates.
