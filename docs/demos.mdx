# Demos

Try out some of our hosted demos to get a feel for Zeno.

### Image Classification with Imagenette

<TryWithZeno url="https://zeno-ml-imagenette.hf.space/" />
<br />

For this classic image classification task on a subset of the whole Imagenet dataset, we are using Zeno to compare two CNN models. It includes multiple distill
functions for image features such as brightness and certain colors. This model includes
model projections, which can be used to find potential model errors.

### Audio Transcription

<TryWithZeno url="https://zeno-ml-audio-transcription.hf.space/" />
<br />

We wanted to compare [Open AI's Whisper model](https://github.com/openai/whisper) with existing off-the-shelf
audio transcription models, in this case the [Silero
model](https://pytorch.org/hub/snakers4_silero-models_stt/). For our evaluation
dataset we used the [Speech Accent
Archive](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/speech-accent-archive), a collection of
audio clips of people from around the world saying the same phrase.

Can you find differences in model performance across geographic regions and other speaker features?

### Auditing Image Generation Models

<TryWithZeno url="https://zeno-ml-diffusiondb.hf.space/" />
<br />

Zeno can also be used for analyses of generative models.
In this example we are exploring the [DiffusionDB](https://poloclub.github.io/diffusiondb/) dataset.
Instead of a typical aggregate metric, we measure the average NSFW level of the prompt and images.

Can you find potential biases in diffusion models, e.g. different levels of NSFW for different types of prompt keywords?

### Q&A Chatbots

<TryWithZeno url="https://zeno-ml-langchain-qa.hf.space/#/explore/" />
<br />

Chatbots like ChatGPT are an increasingly popular application of language models, and libraries like [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) are making it much easier to implement LLM-based applications. In this demo we use Zeno to explore how well a LangChain model for answering questions over a [Notion database](https://github.com/hwchase17/chat-langchain-notion) performs.

### Sensor Data Exploration

<TryWithZeno url="https://zeno-ml-imu-classification.hf.space/" />
<br />

Zeno can also be used for unstructured data exploration.
In this demo, we explore the [MotionSense](https://github.com/mmalekzadeh/motion-sense) dataset of IPhone sensor data.
This demo could be extended to include activity classification models.

Can you find interesting sensor patterns between the different activities?

### Translation

<TryWithZeno url="https://zeno-ml-translation-report.hf.space" />
<br />

Explore the performance of a dozen different translation models on a subset of the [WMT 2014 English-German dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wmt14). Compare them across different metrics, including BLEU and BERTScore.
