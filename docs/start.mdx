# Creating a Project

Creating a new Zeno project is super easy.
All you need is a Zeno account and some data you want to upload and investigate.
We will go thruogh creating your first project step by step, but also have the complete code example right here for your reference:

<details>
  <summary>Complete Example</summary>
  <div>
    ```python
    from zeno_client import ZenoClient, ZenoMetric
    import pandas as pd
    
    client = ZenoClient("YOUR API KEY HERE")
    
    df = pd.DataFrame(
      {
          "id": [1, 2, 3],
          "text": [
              "I love this movie!",
              "I hate this movie!",
              "This movie is ok.",
          ],
          "label": ["positive", "negative", "neutral"],
      }
    )

    # Add any additional columns you want to do analysis across.
    df["input length"] = df["text"].str.len()

    # Create a project.
    project = client.create_project(
    name="Sentiment Classification",
    view="text-classification",
    metrics=[
        ZenoMetric(name="accuracy", type="mean", columns=["correct"]),
      ]
    )

    # Upload the data.
    project.upload_dataset(df, id_column="id", data_column='text', label_column="label")

    # Create a system DataFrame.
    df_system = pd.DataFrame(
      {
        "output": ["positive", "negative", "negative"],
      }
    )

    # Create an id column to match the base dataset.
    df_system["id"] = df_system.index

    # Measure accuracy for each instance, which is averaged by the ZenoMetric above.
    df_system["correct"] = (df_system["output"] == df["label"]).astype(int)

    proj.upload_system(df_system, name="System A", id_column="id", output_column="output")
    ```

  </div>
</details>

## Zeno Account

If you don't have a Zeno account already, create one on [Zeno Hub](https://hub.zenoml.com/signup).
After logging in to Zeno Hub, generate your API key by clicking on your profile at the top right to navigate to your [account page](https://hub.zenoml.com/account).

## Data Upload

We're uploading data directly from Python.
This makes it easy for you to start your evaluation right where you do your AI system development.

### Zeno Client

To get all the functions used to upload new datasets and AI system outputs, install the `zeno-client` Python package:

```bash
pip install zeno-client
```

We can now initialize a client with our API key and use it to create a project and upload data.

```python
from zeno_client import ZenoClient, ZenoMetric
import pandas as pd

# Initialize a client with our API key.
client = ZenoClient("YOUR API KEY HERE")
```

:::tip
If you want to learn more about our Python client, read our [client API docs](/docs/python-client).
:::

### Data Format

Zeno takes any data that you provide in a **Pandas DataFrame**.
In this example, we look at text sentiment classification:

```python
...

# Put all data in a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "id": [1, 2, 3],
        "text": [
            "I love this movie!",
            "I hate this movie!",
            "This movie is ok.",
        ],
        "label": ["positive", "negative", "neutral"],
    }
)

# Add any additional columns you want to do analysis across.
df["input length"] = df["text"].str.len()
```

### Zeno Project

**Projects** in Zeno are a base dataset and any number of AI system outputs used to evaluate and compare model performance.
Here we create a project and upload our base dataset.

```python
...

project = client.create_project(
    name="Sentiment Classification",
    view="text-classification",
    metrics=[
        ZenoMetric(name="accuracy", type="mean", columns=["correct"]),
    ]
)

project.upload_dataset(df, id_column="id", data_column='text', label_column="label")
```

We named our project _Sentiment Classification_ and specified to use the _text_classification_ view.
We also added an _accuracy_ metric which takes the mean of the `correct` column that will be present in the system outputs we upload later.

### System Outputs

Next, we can upload some system outputs to evaluate. Here we'll upload some fake predictions from a model:

```python
...

df_system = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "output": ["positive", "negative", "negative"],
    }
)

# Create an id column to match the base dataset.
df_system["id"] = df_system.index

# Measure accuracy for each instance, which is averaged by the ZenoMetric above.
df_system["correct"] = (df_system["output"] == df["label"]).astype(int)

proj.upload_system(df_system, name="System A", id_column="id", output_column="output")
```

You can now navigate to the project URL in Zeno Hub to see the uploaded data and metrics and start exploring your AI system's performance!

## Quickstart with Zeno Build

[Zeno Build](https://github.com/zeno-ml/zeno-build) is a Python project that contains a collection of example projects for common AI and ML tasks. Check out some common Zeno Build notebooks:

- [EleutherAI LM Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/zeno-ml/zeno-build/tree/main/examples/eleuther_harness)
- [ðŸ¤— OpenLLM Leaderboard](https://github.com/zeno-ml/zeno-build/tree/main/examples/open_llm_leaderboard)
- [Audio Transcription Bias](https://github.com/zeno-ml/zeno-build/tree/main/examples/transcription)
