# View Specification

With the View Specifications, you can create a bespoke Instance View that is just right for your Zeno project.
In fact, all the [preconfigured views](/docs/views/existing) get turned into such a specification by our backend.
For example, the **image-classification** view is interpreted as:

<CodeBlock language="json">
  {`{
  "data": {
    "type": "image"
  },
  "label": {
    "type": "text"
  },
  "output": {
    "type": "text"
  }
}
`}
</CodeBlock>

You can explore all the available preconfigured view specifications and experiment with your own specification on our [Instance View Playground](https://zeno-ml.github.io/instances/).
If you want to learn how to write your own view specification, get started withe [Toplevel Specification](/docs/views/spec/toplevel).
